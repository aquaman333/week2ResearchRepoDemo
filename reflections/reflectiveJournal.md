## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?

### What is visual programming?

Visual programming enables anyone to illustrate the command visually hence make it easy for anyone program or make the computer do what they want . 

### Can you put the changes in Git up to GitHub form the IDE?

Yes it's possible, only if I remember my password or if I have authorised this computer

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

Programming pirnciples 
- Simple coding -Try to keep your programming as simple as possible . This will help a co- programmer to relate with the code 
- Donot Repeat Code - Try not to use the code again and again . Its best to use loop and define functions which helps you to finish to repeat the process where ever needed.
- Comment code where ever possible - Commenting code where ever possible will help you while debugging the program . Also helps someone other than you to understand your code 
  

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?

## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is free and open source software for distributed version control: tracking changes in any set of files of your source code history , usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include  data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

### What is GitHub?
